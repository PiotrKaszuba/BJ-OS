# BJ-OS
A team operating system project simulating MS Windows solutions. My task was to write File System (FAT8) module with abstract HDD that had basic operation of reading/writing whole segment of data. System is in Polish. Type help to get possible shell instructions. You can look up processor registers, memory or file system. You can define your own program with our basic assembler instructions which are unfortunately unavailable at the moment. If you are interested in testing example programs loaded in BJ-OS memory or defining your own contact me and I will give you more feedback.
